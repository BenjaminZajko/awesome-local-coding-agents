  "## Why this list exists",
  "",
  "Many coding agents say they support Ollama or an OpenAI-compatible endpoint. That does not tell you whether the agent is practical with a 7B, 8B, or 14B model, whether tool calls survive weaker models, how much context the harness burns, or what hardware was used.",
  "",
  "This repository separates **documented local compatibility** from **measured small-model performance**. The long-term goal is to answer questions like:",
  "",
  "- What is the best CLI coding agent for a 16 GB Apple Silicon machine?",
  "- Which harness works reliably with a <=14B coder model?",
  "- Which agent has the lowest tool-call failure rate with local inference?",
  "- Which model + quantization + runtime combination is actually reproducible?",
  "",
  "## Legend",
  "",
  "- 🟢 **Local-first** — local inference is a first-class design path.",
  "- 🟡 **Local-capable** — documented local inference exists, but it is not the project's primary identity.",
  "- 🧪 **Candidate** — engineering signals suggest small-model friendliness, but qualifying benchmark evidence has not been submitted.",
  "- ✅ **Verified** — qualifying <=14B benchmark evidence exists in this repository.",
  "- ◻️ **Unverified** — local support is documented, but no small-model claim is made.",
